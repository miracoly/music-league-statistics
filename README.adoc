== Motivation
https://musicleague.com/[MusicLeague] is an awesome online game where you submit Spotify songs to different topics. Each player can then rate the songs. Whoever gets the most points wins.

*Guess Who:* After some normal rounds our group decided to play league where we have to guess, who submitted the song. This script helps to get a better profile about each player and helps decide, who might submit which song.

=== Result
The result is a table of all submitted songs per round and league by player.
